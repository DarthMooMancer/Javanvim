### What is Polydev?
Polydev is a simple plugin that gives neovim some nice functions while being extremely extensible for developers. It automatically detects your language and enables the module for that language. It is a standalone plugin that has no dependencies aside from getting file types. Below are a few features that are currently implemented:

* Creating New Projects
* Creating New Files
* Building Files
* Running Files
* Builtin Terminal
